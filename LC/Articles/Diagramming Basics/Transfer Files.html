				<ol>
					<li>Log in to the account with files to be transferring.</li>
					<li>Create a folder by selecting ‘+ Folder’ on the <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/documents">Documents Page</a>.</li>
					<li>Drag the documents to be shared into the folder.</li>
					<li>Hover over the folder on the Document page and select ‘Share’ or right click the folder in the left panel and select ‘Share’.</li>
					<li>Share with the other account(s).</li>
					<li>Make sure to give ‘Can edit and share’ access.</li>
					<li>The shared folder will appear in the user's’ ‘Shared with me’ section on the left panel. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>Note: Sharing documents does not transfer document ownership. When the owner of the document deletes a document, the document is also removed from the shared users’ accounts.</p>
