<p>You can gain the benefits of Lucidchart without losing your shapes from Visio. Import your Visio stencils using the instructions below.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open the shape manager from inside the editor (using the “More Shapes” button or [M] on your keyboard).</li>
	<li>Click “Visio Stencil” button in the top-left corner of the window.</li>
	<li>Click “Choose File,” and select the Visio stencil file from your computer.</li>
	<li>Click “Upload.” Wait for the file to import (files larger than 1 MB can take longer than one minute). Imported stencils will appear in their own custom library.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205307346/Capture.PNG" alt="" /></li>

<h2>Troubleshoot Visio imports</h2>
Visio import for Lucidchart is still in beta, so occasionally uploads will fail or diagrams will leave out a line or box here or there. Check out these suggestions to ensure that your upload is successful:</p>
<h3>File size</h3>
<Spacer>If the import process takes longer than a few minutes, your file might be too large (&gt;40 MB) and you’ll need to modify it. You can try:</Spacer>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Compressing user images:</strong> Typically, files are too large due to large user images placed inside the diagram. You can resolve this issue by optimizing the images to 72 dpi and ~1,000 pixels on the long side.</li>
	<li><strong>Dividing the document:</strong> If your file has multiple pages, try re-saving it to multiple files that have fewer pages and/or objects.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Saving as .vsd:</strong> VSD files are generally much smaller than VDX files so they should upload easier.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version/format</h3>
<p>You may get an error because you have uploaded a file in a format or version that we do not support. We currently support VSD files made with Microsoft Visio 2007 or later and VDX files made with Visio 2003 or later. If you have an older Visio file, consider re-saving it with a more recent version of Visio.</p>
<p>Because Lucidchart has supported VDX import for longer than VSD, you can also try saving it as a VDX for a higher fidelity result.</p>
