<p>The Timeline shape library allows you to easily create to show past events, future plans, or how to manage a project's completion.</p>
<p>Currently, the Timeline library is available for users in the beta editor. By pressing the gear icon on the top of the shapes toolbox, you can pin the Timeline shapes to the toolbox. Then, you can easily drag and drop the elements of a timeline onto the canvas.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205081743/timeline.PNG" alt="" width="1457" height="378" /></p>
<p>Timeline elements include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Timeline block:</strong> This is the base of your timeline. When you drag this shape onto the canvas, you can set the start and finish date and time on the advanced settings drawer that pops open on the top of the Editor. You can also specify date formatting as well as the types of time markers: seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, quarters, or years. </li>
	<li><strong>Milestone:</strong> This marker allows you to specify a point of a significant event. It will snap to position when you change the date in the advanced settings drawer or when you place it into position on the timeline.</li>
	<li><strong>Interval:</strong> This shape allows you to show events that span over a period of time. Use the advanced shape drawer to enter start and end dates or drag the shape on the timeline until it's the correct time span. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Timeline shape library is great for educators and students as well as for project management. Creating history and story plot timelines is intuitive and quick. For project management, Gantt charts often use timeline elements, so building your own Gantt chart with our Timeline and Flowchart shapes is easy.</p>
