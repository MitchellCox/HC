<p>Collaboration is one of the core benefits of Lucidchart. See below to learn how to invite collaborators and set permissions for document collaborators.</p>
<h3>Invite collaborators and set permissions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Click “Share” from the Menu bar and select “Invite Collaborator(s)” or click the “Share” button in the top right corner. A menu will appear.</li>
	<li>To share through email, simply enter the email address(es) of intended collaborators. Team accounts have a drop-down menu with all team members and groups listed. Depending on your account level, you may be limited to a certain number of collaborators.</li>
	<li>Assign your collaborators a permission level. An <strong>owner</strong> is equal to you and has the same ability to share and determine permission for other users. An <strong>editor</strong> can modify the document but not invite others. A <strong>viewer</strong> can simply view the document and interact with any demos, and a commenter can view the document and leave comments.</li>
	<li>Once you have determined collaborators and permissions, click “Share.”<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205193306/Capture.PNG" alt="" width="763" height="604" /></li>
</ol>
<p>You can also generate a one-time or multiuse link that can be quickly messaged or emailed by selecting “Access Link.” To change the number of uses or permission level, toggle “Multi-use link” or select an option from the drop-down menu. Once you click “Generate Link,” you can copy and paste it where you would like.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205260243/Capture.PNG" alt="" /></p>
