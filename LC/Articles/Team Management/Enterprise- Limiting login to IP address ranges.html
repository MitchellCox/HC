<p>For our enterprise customers, we offer the ability to prevent members of the account from logging in from unauthorized IP address ranges.</p>
<p>To access this feature, the admin must go to the <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/teams">Team Page</a> and then click on the card labeled “Identity Management.”<br /><br /><img src="/attachments/token/R6Dn1vchH3dxs4rdtpUiK6L8v/?name=idmgmt.PNG" alt="idmgmt.PNG" /></p>
<p>From there, the admin can browse the identity management features that are available on his or her account. If you go to “User Sign In” on the left side, you will see the feature that allows you to limit login to specific IP ranges and can set your account from here.</p>
<p><em>Note: This feature will not prevent users from logging in, staying logged in, and then moving from one IP address to another.</em></p>
<strong>CIDR Notation:</strong> The feature uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">CIDR</span></a> notation to denote IP ranges, e.g. 192.168.2.0/24.</p>
