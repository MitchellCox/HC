<p><strong>What is the Auto-Upgrade feature?</strong></p>

<p>Auto-upgrade is a feature that allows your team to grow as the number of team members using the product increases. Only Billings Admin and Account managers have control over this function. With auto-upgrade turned off, you will be required to manually choose each new level as your team grows in size. Without choosing a new level, new team members wonâ€™t be able to use Lucidchart.</p>

<p>Enabling auto-upgrade allows your team to grow as new members join and become licensed. How will your team grow? If you are currently on a team 3, we will add two more licenses, taking you to a team 5. If you are currently on a team 5, you will get five more licenses, upgrading your team to a team 10. After that, each additional upgrade will add ten licenses to the team.</p>
