<p>On our Free account level, users are allowed three active documents, and have the opportunity each calendar month to create one additional document. An active document is any document that has not been moved to the trash.</p>

<p>If you run into the limit, you will see this dialogue:</p>

<p><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203428313/ThreeDocumentLimit.jpg" alt="" width="177" height="179" /></p>

<p>You can delete old documents and create new ones, as long as the total document count remains at or below three. Don’t worry, even after you’ve reached the three-document limit, you’ll be able to create one new document each month.</p>

<p>Need to create more than one document a month? All of our premium plans allow for unlimited active documents, and upgrading is a quick and easy.
