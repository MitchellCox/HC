				<ul>
					<li>After you've opened your Azure shape library, you'll see the shapes populated on the left toolbox within your document's Editor. </li>
					<li>From the left toolbox, you can drag and drop the icons you need onto the canvas. Each icon has a name when you hover over it to help you decide on which to use. You can also use the "search" option on the top of the toolbox to type in the name of a shape you're looking for.<em>Pro Tip: </em>If you're looking for buckets to place your icons into on the canvas, try the "Containers" library. This keeps your Azure diagram organized and easy to read.</li>
					<li>To connect your shapes, hover over the edge of one of the icons and use the crosshairs (+) to drag out a line and connect it to another part of your diagram. Check out <a href="/entries/21604044-Draw-lines-and-objects">this tutorial</a> for more info.</li>
					<li>Use the "Standard" library to add plain text boxes to your document as labels and accompanying explanations.</li>
					<li>To add interactivity, use <a href="/entries/21604174-Links-Layers-and-Hotspots">links, hotspots, and layers</a>. Using these options, you can jump from page to page, bring viewers to a website with specifications, or show and hide certain portions of your diagram. </li>
