<p>If you've had trouble opening a document in Drive, and saw a growl about data access permissions being out-of-date, you're missing some permissions on your Google account. We can help!</p>

<p><strong>If you found the Lucidchart App in Drive on your own:</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>On your own Google account, go to the <a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?pli=1">account permissions page</a>. There, revoke access for Lucidchart entirely. Then, the next time you try to log in, you'll be prompted to re-grant access to your Google account. That should refresh your permissions and allow you to connect properly to Google Drive. Please make sure to log in and go to your <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/users/googleDrive?__hstc=215508872.57149cdcc11fcdc3299a4400c1110832.1472584145488.1473201387758.1473267881990.12&amp;__hssc=215508872.28.1473267881990&amp;__hsfp=2181564343">Lucidchart GDrive page</a> to check your settings there as well, after you've re-granted access.</li>
	</ul>

<p><strong>If Lucidchart is domain-installed, your domain super admin needs to follow these steps:</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>On the admin’s Google Apps domain, navigate to the <a href="/hc/admin/articles/207323826-How-to-reset-your-Google-Drive-account-s-data-access-to-Lucidchart/admin.google.com">admin console</a> and select the Lucidchart app installed on the domain. Ensure that the Lucidchart diagrams app reads “Data access granted.”</li>
	</ul>
