				<h3>Managing Users</h3>
				<p>Lucidchart's plugin for Confluence includes new features to manage your team from the admin dashboard inside Confluence. Go to the Configuration page. Ensure that your account is linked then click the 'User Management' tab. There are 3 sections:</p>
				<p><strong>Lucidchart team management</strong></p>
				<p>This table is a list of users that are currently on your Lucidchart team and whether they have connected their Lucidchart account with Confluence. Users that appear in this table are on a paid Team account and will have access to all features and functionality of Lucidchart. You can manage additional team settings from the <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/teams">Team page</a> at lucidchart.com or using the second table on the User Management page.</p>
				<p><strong>Non-Lucidchart team management</strong></p>
				<p>This table is a list of all users from your instance that have clicked the Add --&gt; Lucidchart Diagram from inside Confluence and were auto-provisioned accounts but not automatically placed on the paid team subscription. They are not on the team subscription because either the team is full or the checkbox below the table is unchecked. Easily click 'add to team' to place them on the paid team subscription and allow them the full functionality of Lucidchart.</p>
				<p><strong>Auto-provision settings</strong></p>
				<p>This checkbox at the bottom of the page makes it easy to control how users from Confluence are able to join Lucidchart. Check the box if you want the team subscription to fill up on a first-come-first-serve basis. Uncheck the box to be able to individually select what users will join the team.</p>
				<p>Use the information in these tables to determine which Lucidchart Team Users are connected to Confluence; and which Lucidchart users have connected their accounts to this Confluence instance, but are not on your Team.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Click the blue “Add to Team” link to start managing these users, then elect to “automatically add new users to your Lucidchart Team.”</li>
					<li>If you don’t have licenses free, click the blue link to go to your Lucidchart Team Management Page and reassign licenses. Or, visit your Lucidchart Subscription Level page to upgrade to the next license tier.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Now, you’re ready to use the add-on!</p>

				<h3>Basic and Dynamic/Rich Viewers</h3>
				<p><strong>Basic Viewer</strong></p>
				<p>If you did not enable the Rich Viewer by default, or downgraded, your diagram will load in a basic viewer. The basic viewer provides a static PNG image of your diagram, hosted on Confluence Servers. You'll see 6 controls:</p>
				<ol>

				<p><strong>Dynamic Viewer</strong></p>
				<p>The Dynamic Viewer requires access to the internet and our servers, but preserves all the interactivity of your document. If you enable the Rich Viewer during configuration, you'll be able to zoom, pan, switch between pages, and use links, hotspots, and layers. The control bar will appear across the entire width of the diagram, and is dark gray. With the controls, you can:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open our homepage in a new tab.</li>
					<li>Edit the diagram in Lucidchart.</li>
					<li>Remove document from Confluence space.</li>
					<li>Switch to the Basic Viewer.</li>
					<li>Update to the latest version of the diagram.</li>
					<li>Zoom to fit.</li>
					<li>Go back to actual size.</li>
					<li>Zoom out.</li>
					<li>Zoom in.</li>
				</ol>
				<p><em>Notes:</em></p>
				<ol>
					<li>Master pages are not viewable in the rich viewer but can be in the basic.</li>
					<li>The rich viewer is available in Chrome, Firefox and Safari, but Internet Explorer will always use the basic viewer.</li>
