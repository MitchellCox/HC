<h1>CMYK, for ProfessionalÂ Printing</h1>
<hr />
<h4>If you're looking to print your document professionally through a print shop, you probably want a very specific set of colors to show in the printed copy--this requires translation from screen color (RGB) to print color (CMYK).</h4>
<h4>In order to correctly translate the RGB color you used in Lucidpress into CMYK color on the printed page, you will need to apply a special set of instructions to your PDF or JPG file, called a "Color Profile."</h4>
<hr />
<p><strong>1)</strong> While in the Editor, click File &gt; Download as in the Menu bar, or use the keyboard shortcuts.<br /><br /><br /><strong>2)</strong> Select PDF, PNG, or JPEG, and click on the drop down for "Color Profiles."<br /><br /></p>

When you take it to a print shop, they will interpret the file and use the color profile we saved with the download.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203381736/Screen_Shot_2016-04-06_at_2.32.12_PM.jpg" alt="" /><br /><br />Some at-home printers market a variety of features as "CMYK" support, but they are not all the same, and do not follow a consistent set of instructions. If you have any questions about how to print in CMYK, contact your printer's manufacturer (HP, Brother, etc), explore their website, or send your file to a print shop for a single printing.<br /><br /><br /></p>
