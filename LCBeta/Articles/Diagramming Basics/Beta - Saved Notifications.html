<p><strong>Saved Notifications</strong></p>
<p>All changes made to your documents will save automatically in Lucidchart. To the left of the File Menu at the top of the editor, the notifications button indicates the current state of your document.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Saving: Will display when you are moving around in your document and making edits.</li>
	<li>Saved: Will display once you stop making changes.</li>
	<li>Paused: Will display when you’re not active in your current document at the moment. The notification will return to “Saved” as soon as you return to the document.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/208713227/Saved.jpg" alt="" /></li>
