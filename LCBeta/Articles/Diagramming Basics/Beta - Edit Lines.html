<p><strong>Edit Lines</strong></p>
<p>The “Line Type” icon in the Options Bar allows you to choose from three types of lines:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Straight</li>
	<li>Elbow</li>
	<li>Curved</li>
</ul>
<p>You can easily customize any line type to fit your diagram, by clicking and dragging one of the blue handles located along the line. If you are working with a curved line, use the handles to adjust the angle of the curve.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/208664568/Lines.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>You can change your arrow and line styles using the arrow and line icons. Use the double arrow icon to change the direction of your arrow.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/208682927/Line_style.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>To add text, double-click anywhere on the line and begin typing. Once you’ve added text, you can drag the text outside the line, inside the line, or anywhere along the line. Anytime you move the line, the text will move with it.</p>
