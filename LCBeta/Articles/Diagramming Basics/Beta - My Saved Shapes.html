<p>In order to simplify your diagramming experience even further, we are introducing “My Saved Shapes” -- a quick and easy way to create a custom library allowing you to reuse your favorite shapes and styles.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/206190228/Screen_Shot_2016-04-04_at_2.12.15_PM.png" alt="" width="131" height="111" /></p>
<p><strong>Adding Shapes </strong></p>
<ul>
	<li >The first time you create a document, access “My Saved Shapes” from the Shape Toolbox or Shape Manager.</li>
	<li>Save a single shape, multiple shapes or grouped shapes.</li>
	<li>Drag and drop shapes from the canvas into “My Saved Shapes”. Once you add shapes, you will be able to reorder the libraries in the Toolbox (before adding shapes, “My Saved Shapes” will remain as the top library).</li>
	<li>Open the Shape Manager to drag and drop shapes from any existing library into “My Saved Shapes”.</li>
	<li>When importing images or SVG files, save them directly to “My Saved Shapes”.</li>
	<li>The next time you create a document, all your favorite shapes and styles will be saved and ready for you. To access them, open the Shapes Manager. You can then pin or drag “My Saved Shapes” into the Shapes Toolbox.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Managing Shapes</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Right click to delete, move, or copy a shape.</li>
	<li>Right click to rename a shape (shapes are given an automatic title when placed in the library).</li>
	<li>Organize the shapes within your library by dragging and dropping.</li>
</ul>
