<p>Lucidchart’s drag-and-drop interface makes it easy to insert lines anywhere on your canvas. Customize your lines by changing the size, shape, style, color, and thickness.</p>
<p>Three ways to draw lines:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Hover over the shape, then click and drag from one of the four red circles.</li>
	<li>Click + drag from anywhere on the shape’s border. Drag and drop the line shape from the Standard Shape Library.</li>
	<li>Right click on the canvas, select “Draw Line”, and click and drag anywhere on the canvas to create a line. The keyboard shortcut to create a line is “L”.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205913067/Insert_Lines_1.JPG" alt="" /></li>

<p>To change the line shape (curved, elbow, direct), select the line and click the Line Style icon in the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217605908" target="_blank">Options Bar.</a><br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/208710107/Lines_2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
