<p><strong>How to Use the Application:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>After downloading the app, sign into Lucidchart through the browser, either by clicking the “Launch app” in the Chrome Web store listing or clicking the Lucidchart icon from a new tab. Doing so will sync your Lucidchart files to your computer, and you only have to do this once.</li>
