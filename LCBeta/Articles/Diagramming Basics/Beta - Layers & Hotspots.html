<p>The Layers panel is ideal for separating elements in a diagram and viewing or hiding them. By default, the editor has no layers. To hide, show, lock, or add interactivity to areas, objects must be placed on a layer. In advanced diagrams like mockups and wireframes, hotspots are used to create interaction; for example, clicking a button can hide or show the specified layers.</p>

<h2><strong>Layers</strong></h2>
<p>A layer is an alternative view on a page. It can be shown or hidden, depending on the action assigned to the hotspot connected to it. Layers allow you to demonstrate user interaction before writing any code. To access layers, select “Layers” from the Right Menu.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/208682507/Layers.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Layers Panel Overview:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Layers List: Default location of all layers associated with the current page. If you are zoomed in or working on a large diagram, click a layer in the list to view that layer's location on the page.</li>
	<li>“+Layer”: Create a new layer.</li>
	<li>“Page New Page”: Default location of all objects added to the editor.</li>
	<li>Eye Icon: Temporarily hide or show the layer. This is also used to sync the visibility of the published diagram.</li>
	<li>Lock Icon: Lock a layer so it can no longer be edited. You can unlock by clicking the lock icon in the Options Bar or the Layers Panel.</li>
	<li>Pen Icon: Rename, delete, or duplicate the layer.</li>
	<li>Sync Visibility: Set the initial visibility state of the published document to match the current visibility state. To do so, select the eye icons for the layers that should appear by default, then click the Sync Visibility button.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Create a layer:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Click “Layers” from the Options Bar.</li>
	<li>Choose the “+Layer” button.</li>
	<li>Type a title for the layer. If you want to change the title, right-click on the current title and select “Rename”.</li>
	<li>To add shapes to a layer, right-click on a shape and choose “Move to Layer”, or double-click on a layer and drag shapes onto the canvas.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Edit a layer:</strong></p>
<p>From the Layers panel, double-click on a layer to edit it. A blue bar will appear on the left side of the layer when it is selected. All items not in that layer will be grayed out on the canvas.</p>
<p>If you click on a layer on the canvas that you aren't currently editing, you'll see a bounding box around all objects on that layer (see image below). If you double-click that layer, editing will be enabled.</p>

<p><strong>Hide/show a layer:</strong></p>
<p>To view a layer, click its eye icon. Remember that if you use the quick preview hotkey (Ctrl+Shift or Cmd+Shift) and click on a hotspot, the eye will be temporarily unsynced.</p>

<p><strong>Lock a layer:</strong></p>
<p>Locking a layer will freeze all objects on the layer. You'll no longer be able to edit the layer. To lock multiple layers at a time, hold Ctrl (Cmd on Mac) and click each layer. The layer must be unselected in order to lock it.</p>

<p><strong>Duplicate a layer:</strong></p>
<p>Duplicating a layer will create a copy in the same place as the original layer. You can choose the page on which a duplicate layer will appear.</p>
<p>To duplicate a layer, right-click or choose the pen icon and select “Duplicate”. Then select the destination page or create a new one.</p>

<p><strong>Reorder layers:</strong></p>
<p>Click and drag to reorder layers.</p>

<p><strong>Move to layers:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Select object(s) from the page or the layer you're currently editing.</li>
	<li>Right-click and select 'Move to Layer'.</li>
	<li>Choose the destination layer or create a new layer, then click 'OK'.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Copy to layers:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Select object(s) from the page or the layer you're currently editing.</li>
	<li>Right-click and select “Copy to Layer”.</li>
	<li>Choose the destination layer or create a new layer.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Sync Visibility:</strong></p>
<p>This feature establishes the default view for users who access a published webpage version of the diagram.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click the eye icon of each layer until the page looks the way it should appear when it's published.</li>
	<li>Click the Sync Visibility icon. When the icon is grayed out, syncing is complete.</li>
	<li>When you update your diagram, it will update on the webpage as well.</li>
</ol>

<p></p>
<h2><strong>Hotspots</strong></h2>
<p>A "hotspot" is a designated area of the canvas that performs an action when selected in Present mode. Hotspots are ideal for UI Mockups and demonstrations.</p>
<p><strong>To create a hotspot:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Drag and drop the green hotspot shape from the standard shape library onto the selected object.You can also right click on a shape to add a hotspot.</li>
	<li>Click on the drop down arrows next to "Choose an Action," and select one of the six actions.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Toggle layers: When you click the selected shape in present mode, it will toggle between hiding and showing everything in the selected layer.</li>
		<li>Show layers: When you click the selected shape in present mode, it will show all objects in the selected layer.</li>
		<li>Hide layers: When you click the selected shape in present mode, it will hide all objects in the selected layer.</li>
		<li>Link to page: When you click the selected shape in present mode, it will take you to the selected page.</li>
		<li>External link: When you click the selected shape in present mode, it will take you to the web URL you entered.</li>
		<li>Link to email: When you click the selected shape in present mode, it will take you to the email you entered.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>If you've chosen a "link" option, enter the required information and click "Done." If you've chosen an action that works with layers, you'll need to select a layer on which the hotspot will act.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have not created a layer yet...</p>
<ol>
	<li>Type a title for the layer into the "Create New Layer" field.</li>
	<li>Click the [+] sign to create the layer.</li>
	<li>Select the layer from the list, and click "Done."<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/206393678/Hotspot.jpg" alt="" /></li>
