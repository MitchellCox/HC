<p>Once you've created your diagram, Lucidchart allows you to build a presentation around it.</p>
<p><strong> To create a presentation:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Build your diagram.</li>
	<li>Click “Present” from the Right Menu.</li>
	<li>Choose “+ Slide” to add a slide to the canvas. You can also right click a shape or group of shapes to add a slide. An orange rectangle will appear on the canvas covering whatever shapes were selected.</li>
	<li>Adjust the size and location of the slide as needed.</li>
	<li>Add additional slides with the "+ Slide". You can even add slides to multiple pages to be included in the same presentation.</li>
	<li>To view your presentation, click the play button located on the bottom of the Right Menu.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/208732827/present_3.jpg" alt="" /></li>
</ol>

<p>You will see thumbnails of each slide in the Right Menu. Click and drag the thumbnails to reorder your slides. Right click a thumbnail to insert a slide. Delete a thumbnail by right clicking or hitting the delete key. You can choose where your presentation begins by selecting a thumbnail and selecting the "Present" button.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/208732727/Present_2.jpg" alt="" width="327" height="592" /></p>
<p>The options icon (the cog symbol) in the Right Menu allows you to change the duration and aspect ratio of the slide. The options for the aspect ratio are 3x2, 4x3, or 16x9, and the default is set at 16x9. To manually adjust the aspect ratio, select the slide, click the Position icon in the Option Bar, click the lock icon to unlock the slide, and adjust the width and height.</p>
<p><strong>To view your presentation, click the play/present button at the bottom of the Right Menu or the play button located above the Right Menu.</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Use the left/right arrow keys to move between slides.</li>
	<li>At the bottom of the editor, there is a grey footer that will appear if you hover over it. It holds a thumbnail of each slide, and you can click along the bar to manually direct the presentation.</li>
	<li>At the top of the editor, there is a grey header that will appear if you hover over it. It allows you to switch between pages. You can click “Back” to exit presentation mode. The escape key will also exit presentation mode.</li>
	<li>The settings icon in the top grey bar allows you to show/hide notes and turn on/off WebGL.</li>
	<li>You can zoom and pan within the presentation.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/208146708/aaaz.PNG" alt="" width="683" height="384" /></li>
