<p>On our Free account level, users are limited to no more than three active documents but will have the opportunity each calendar month to create one additional document. If you have three documents or fewer, a document can be deleted to enable the creation of additional documents.</p>
<p><strong>If you run into the limit, you will see this dialogue:</strong><br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/206149947/ThreeDocumentLimit.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Each calendar month users will be allowed to create one additional document beyond their three-doc limit. This does not fundamentally change your limit but enables you to exceed it by one additional document each month. For example, if you create three documents in your first month, you can create one additional document at the start of your next month. If you delete that fourth document, you will not be able to create an additional one until the next month, as your core document limit remains at three and you already created your extra document for the month.</p>
<p>To access your free document you must create it during the calendar month. For example, if you don't create a new document in April, in May you will only be able to create May's free document -- the April opportunity will be expired.</p>
<p>All of our premium plans allow for unlimited active documents. If you would like to have more than three active documents, please upgrade <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/users/level?__hstc=215508872.212bdec455d57ea79e7654046badb4fd.1452549069289.1459202370993.1459267444409.78&amp;__hssc=215508872.2.1459267444409&amp;__hsfp=669258439">here</a>, or visit your Subscription Level page.</p>
