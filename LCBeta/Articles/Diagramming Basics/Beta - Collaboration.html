<p>You can make diagramming a group experience by inviting collaborators to view, edit, or comment on your document, depending on the permission level you grant them. For more information on how to do this, click <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217607168">here</a>.</p>
<p>The top right corner of the editor shows which collaborators are on a document at any given time. Each person will appear as a colored bar with an initial. When you hover over the bar, the full name of the collaborator will appear.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/208718868/collaborate.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>When someone is editing a shape, the shape will be outlined in the color assigned to that collaborator. If you hover over the shape, you can see their full name. If you are in view-only mode, you will not be able to see collaborators.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/208147788/Screenshot__13_.png" alt="" /></p>
