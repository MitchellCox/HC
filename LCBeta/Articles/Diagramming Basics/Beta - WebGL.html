<p><strong>WebGL</strong></p>
<p>WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D computer graphics and 2D graphics with any compatible browser without the use of plug-ins. It essentially uses your graphics card instead of plugins.</p>
<p>If your graphics card is compatible, WebGL can significantly increase the speed of Lucidchart. However, if your card is not compatible, you may experience problems. If this happens, you can turn off WebGL by clicking the View dropdown menu and deselecting “Use WebGL."<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/208713847/webgl.jpg" alt="" /></p>
